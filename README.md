# NLP-Project-Fall-23
**Sentiment Analysis Comparison Using Multiple Pre-trained Models **

**Statement of Project Objectives**
Evaluate the performance of multiple pre-trained models on diverse sentiment analysis datasets (social media data (Twitter), Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Review, Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Datasets).
Analyze and compare attention weights to understand model decision-making processes.
Investigate fine-tuning strategies and transfer learning capabilities.
Provide insights into the limitations and challenges of each model.

**Statement of Value
Importance of Sentiment Analysis:**
Gain a deep understanding of how different pre-trained models perform on sentiment analysis tasks.
Provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in natural language processing.
Contribute to the understanding of attention weights and their role in sentiment analysis models.

**Review of the State of the Art
Brief Overview of Sentiment Analysis**
Traditional Methods vs. Deep Learning Approaches:
Traditional sentiment analysis methods often rely on predefined rules, while deep learning approaches leverage neural networks to grasp complex patterns in language, enabling more accurate and nuanced sentiment classification.

**Current State of Sentiment Analysis Research:**

Models: BERT, RoBERTa, GPT, and XLNet are widely used.
Techniques: Transfer learning, attention mechanisms, and fine-tuning strategies prevail.
Datasets: Diverse datasets such as IMDb, Amazon Reviews, and Twitter datasets are common.

**Emerging Trends:**
Multimodal sentiment analysis, domain adaptation, and cross-lingual sentiment analysis are emerging trends.

**Approach**
Algorithms, Datasets, Models, Tools, and Techniques
Algorithms: Utilize pre-trained transformer models for sentiment analysis.
Datasets: Include diverse sentiment analysis datasets covering different domains.
Models: Compare RoBERTa, BERT, GPT, XLNet, and DistilBERT.
